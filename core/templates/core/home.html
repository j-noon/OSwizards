      OS Wizards is a shared tavern for the Oz Wizards community — a single place to unwind, 
      chat, and conjure up ideas for future streams. It’s where misfits, role-players,
      and chaos-friendly adventurers come together to share laughs, pitch wild campaign ideas,
      and even apply to jump into games with the Dungeon Masters themselves. Between quests,
      you can tackle mini-games to earn points toward discounts in the merch shop, all while soaking
      up good vibes and questionable decisions. We don’t take ourselves too seriously — we just 
      love great stories, ridiculous moments, and building something fun together.
